            <p class="paragraph">GST or say “ Goods and Services Tax” is  one of the biggest tax reforms (in terms of
                indirect taxes) in India came into effect from July 1, 2017. Under this fabled tax system,
                the tax payers in India will pay a consolidated tax instead of the plethora of taxes such
                as Value-Added Tax (VAT), Central Excise, Service Tax, Entry Tax or Octroi, Customs
                Duty, Central Surcharge &amp; Cess, Luxury Tax, Entertainment Tax, and Purchase Tax and
                a few other indirect taxes. Thereby helping to consolidate, streamline and make easier
                and more effective the process of indirect taxation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The tax rates, rules and regulations are governed by the GST Council which comprises
                finance ministers of centre and all the states. GST simplified a slew of indirect taxes
                with an unified tax and is therefore expected to dramatically reshape the country.
                GST is levied at every step in the production process, but is refunded to all parties
                in the chain of production other than the final consumer.

            <p class="paragraph">A ‘taxable person’ under GST, is a person who carries on any business at any place in
                India and who is registered or required to be registered under the GST Act. Any person who engages in
                economic activity including trade and commerce is treated as taxable person.</p>

                taxpayers with an annual turnover of Rs. 20 lakh (Rs. 10 lakh for special category States). Under the
                threshold limit taxpayer can Suo-moto take GST registration, whereas above the threshold limit it has to
                be mandatory to take registration under GST Act.</p>

                With GST, all states in India will have the same tax rate, either on the supply of goods or services or
                both, which will bring down the logistics costs for many businesses, whether on Supply of Goods or
                Services or both. However, while filing for GST, they have to execute only two types of registration,
                one for State-GST and another for Central-GST.
